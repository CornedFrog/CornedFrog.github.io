<h1><strong>Christian Rhetoric in the Colonial World</strong></h1>
</div>
<p>The history of colonialism is inherently connected to the missionary movements and religious justification that provided the foundational justification for imperial practices.By saving the souls of the world’s many people, Europeans argued that their imperial projects were for the greater good, ultimately benefiting the people they colonized. Thanks to their ‘Civilizing Mission,’ Christianity spread to all corners of the globe and still remains the largest religion within our modern world. Converts within the colonies, however, rarely took this idea at face value, and instead understood Christianity within their own unique contexts.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to explore the many ways Christian ideas, rhetoric, and communities were used by people within a colonial world. While Christianity was first used as a justification for why colonization should be allowed to happen, but colonized people were not passive and responded in a variety of sometimes unintended ways. Some, embraced these new ideas, and in many cases were able to use their new faith to their benefit within the colonial system. Others used these same ideas the Europeans used to justify domination to resist imperialism instead. This project focuses primarily on the British Imperial holdings, and specifically on the Caribbean, Southern Africa, and Oceania.</p>
