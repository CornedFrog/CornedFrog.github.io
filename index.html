<h1><strong>Christian Rhetoric in the Colonial World</strong></h1>
</div>
<p>The history of colonialism is inherently connected to the missionary movements and religious justification that provided the foundational justification for imperial practices. By saving the souls of the world’s many people, Europeans argued that their imperial projects were for the greater good, ultimately benefiting the people they colonized. Thanks to their ‘Civilizing Mission,’ Christianity spread to all corners of the globe and still remains the largest religion within our modern world. Converts within the colonies, however, rarely took this idea at face value, and instead understood Christianity within their own unique contexts.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to explore the many ways Christian ideas, rhetoric, and communities were used by people within a colonial world. While Christianity was first used as a justification for why colonization should be allowed to happen, but colonized people were not passive and responded in a variety of sometimes unintended ways. Some, embraced these new ideas, and in many cases were able to use their new faith to their benefit within the colonial system. Others used these same ideas the Europeans used to justify domination to resist imperialism instead. This project focuses primarily on the British Imperial holdings, and specifically on the Caribbean, Southern Africa, and Oceania.</p>

  <h3>Control</h3>
  <p>The most obvious and well recognized use of Christian rhetoric was as a method of control. This is the category that best fits the views of the colonizers, as Christianity, particularly once rhetorically and ideologically connected to the idea of "civilization." By framing non-Christian people as "uncivilized," Europeans framed their imperial ventures as being beneficial to colonized people, claiming it lifted them out of their "uncivilized" lives, and saved their souls. With this justification in hand, Europeans set about creating methods to control colonized peoples. This was done by adding regimentation to days, forcing Native observance of certain rituals, and other similar practices.

  <h3>Resistance</h3>
  <p>Even when colonized peoples converted to Christianity that did not always mean that they thought about their new faith in the same way the Europeans intended them to. While Europeans might stress notions of obedience before authority, colonized people might instead latch onto ideas of universal Christian brotherhood and ultimate equality before God. Such Christian ideologies and rhetoric helped to provide a solid foundation from which to build and articulate anti-colonial messages and movements while also turning the tools of the colonizers back against them.</p>

  <h3>Accommodation</h3>
  <p>Colonized peoples were presented with a choice to accept or reject the new religion of the missionaries and colonial powers. Those who accepted Christianity, be it through genuine conviction or simply a calculated move to adapt to the new colonial order, found new opportunities opened to them. They might find it easier to send their children to schools, or the hierarchies of the Christian churches might have opened new avenues to gain a social prestige and authority. Christian leaders might even find that they could call upon European political support for their own projects by invoking a shared faith.</p>

As a result, none of this project would be possible without the resources and feedback provided by both Dr. Wisnicki and the rest of the class. Special thanks to both Tine Le and Arka Maitra who helped create the Twine adventure.</p>
